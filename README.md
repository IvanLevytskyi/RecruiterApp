# Recruiter App

## Brief description of the project

This project is an example of what a platform for automating the recruitment process could look like, providing effective interaction between recruiters and candidates using Salesforce. Candidates access the platform through the Digital Experience, which allows them to conveniently apply for jobs, update their data, skills, and resumes.
